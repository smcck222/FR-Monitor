4. Read about different FR products (Ari will share) and see what they do. Check out the issues with those because we want to build a mature product, which is robust.

7. Figure out a way to send JSON output to dashboard. 

   - Send label alone 
   - Send frame + label. How to send the frame, take care of it later.
