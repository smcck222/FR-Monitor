30/12/2020 UPDATE - Sherin 
------------------------------
Tried uninstalling and reinstalling dlib, face_recognition.
Tried multiple versions of dlib, numpy, face_recognition. 
Gave up on that. 
OBSERVATION: No errors thrown, program simply terminates. Even inside a try except block, it doesn't throw an exception. 

Uninstalled dlib, face_recognitio again. 
Installed visual studio buildtools (compiler for cmake), cmake, dlib, face_recognition. 
(Installers are in the download folder)
Face encoding works. (tested with test.py) 
Installed Sublime text editor because IDLE is a pain. 

TODO: 
1. Look into the pic Pranav sent on Whatsapp and fix the webcam setting at the startup of Remote Connection Desktop. 
2. Run FR1.py and check if webcam works fine. 
3. Debug any other errors in FR1.py. 
4. Make FR1 a task and check if it runs on bootup of the VM. 
5. Setup Spring Server, work out communication between FR App and the server. 
6. Research how face_encodings and compare_faces works in the face_recognition module. 
7. Test FR app for multiple test cases and fine tune for accuracy. 
 
UPDATE DOCS: 
1. How to add Python PATH, fix that error. 
2. Mention final libraries with their versions.
